# Generic-Stack-In-C
Implemented stack data structure that supports all the basic data type in C. It can be included as a header file and can be used in a similar manner as the stack in C++.

* stack(T) => Determines type of stack i.e T
* stac_init(&V) => creates the stack V of type T
* stack_get(&V,int index) => gets the value from the index i.e found function
* stack_top() => gets the value from the top of stack
* stack_size() => gets the size of stack
* stack_set(&V,int index,T data) => changes the value at index
* stack_push(&V,val) => pushes val at the top of stack
* stack_pop(&V)  => pops out the  val from the top of stack
